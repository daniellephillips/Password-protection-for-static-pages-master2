<p>This research was a crucial piece of a larger initiative exploring AI-powered workloads, aimed at refining and optimizing performance analysis tools. Conducted over several months, this extensive study brought together internal stakeholders and an external research firm to ensure an unbiased, third-party perspective.
The process began with internal stakeholder interviews to validate existing assumptions, followed by qualitative user interviews that compared the experiences of NVIDIA Nsight and Intel VTune Profiler users. This competitive analysis revealed deeper insights into how AI developers optimize workloads, their pain points, and what they truly need from performance profiling tools.</p> 
<p>Key findings highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven recommendations, simplified interfaces, and smart guidance to streamline optimization. The study's conclusions informed actionable next steps, guiding future research and product improvements.
Deliverables included a detailed research plan, discussion guide, participant interview recordings, and a synthesized analysis of key patterns and opportunities. This body of work ultimately influenced strategic decisions and product enhancements, reinforcing the importance of user-centered research in AI workload optimization.</p>
<p>The "Research for AI Workloads" presentation focuses on understanding the evolving needs of AI engineers, data scientists, and machine learning specialists when optimizing AI workloads. The research compared NVIDIA Nsight Compute with Intelâ€™s VTune Profiler to identify user pain points and opportunities for improvement. Key findings reveal that many AI developers are less focused on deep kernel optimizations and more interested in high-level performance tuning with AI-driven recommendations. Users want smarter, automated insights, intuitive interfaces, and seamless integration into their development workflows rather than relying on separate performance analysis tools.</p>

<p>The study highlights the growing demand for AI-powered optimization tools that offer simplified, actionable recommendations instead of overwhelming users with raw performance metrics. Memory analysis and run comparisons were found to be the most valuable features, while timeline views and metric formulas analysis were not as useful. Major pain points include steep learning curves, lack of integration, and poor visualization of optimization data. To address these, the recommendations emphasize AI-assisted debugging, better visualization, customizable dashboards, and integrated insights directly within AI development environments. These insights will help Intel refine VTune Profiler to better serve AI workload developers and compete with industry standards.</p> </td>

                    <td><p>The "AI Distributed Cloud Research" study specifically focused on understanding the evolving needs of AI engineers, data scientists, and cloud architects when deploying and optimizing AI workloads across distributed cloud infrastructures. The research compared industry-leading AI orchestration frameworks to identify user pain points and opportunities for innovation. Key insights revealed that AI teams are shifting away from manual resource allocation and deep hardware-level optimizations in favor of AI-driven automation and high-level orchestration. Users seek intelligent workload scheduling, real-time performance insights, and adaptive scaling rather than traditional, manual infrastructure tuning.</p>
<p>Findings highlight the growing need for AI-powered cloud optimization tools that provide actionable recommendations rather than overwhelming users with raw performance metrics. Dynamic resource allocation, latency reduction strategies, and automated debugging emerged as the most valuable features, while complex manual tuning interfaces and fragmented cloud toolchains were identified as major pain points. To address these challenges, recommendations emphasize AI-driven workload management, enhanced visualization dashboards, predictive scaling, and seamless integration into AI development pipelines. These insights will help shape next-generation AI cloud tools, ensuring they meet the evolving needs of AI-driven organizations while staying competitive in a rapidly advancing industry.</p></td>
